Sign Language Detection with Voice Assistance

This project is an AI-driven tool designed to recognize sign language gestures in real time and provide voice feedback for each recognized gesture. It aims to bridge communication gaps by interpreting and vocalizing sign language, enabling easier interactions between sign language users and non-signers.

Project Overview

The system leverages computer vision and deep learning to detect gestures, classify them, and generate an audio response. By utilizing MediaPipe for real-time landmark detection and an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for sequence prediction, the model is able to recognize gestures with impressive accuracy and provide spoken feedback.

Key Features

Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Detects hand gestures through live video input.
Voice Assistance: Outputs audio feedback for each recognized gesture using Google Text-to-Speech.
Interactive Visualization: Displays the recognized action in the video feed, allowing users to see real-time classification results.
How It Works
Detection: A live video feed captures hand and body landmarks using MediaPipe, which tracks the key points of the userâ€™s movements.
Gesture Classification: The detected key points are processed in sequences by an LSTM model, trained to classify specific gestures.
Audio Feedback: When a gesture is recognized, the system uses Google Text-to-Speech to vocalize the detected gesture, making it accessible for those unfamiliar with sign language.
Applications
This project has potential applications in:

Accessibility: Assisting communication with and for individuals who use sign language.
Education: Helping learners familiarize themselves with sign language gestures.
Healthcare: Enabling smoother interactions between healthcare providers and patients who rely on sign language.
Future Enhancements
Planned improvements include:

Expanding Gesture Library: Adding more gestures for comprehensive communication.
Multi-Language Support: Offering audio feedback in multiple languages.
Standalone Application: Packaging it as an application for broader accessibility.
